Family

I know water that’s thicker than blood that’s deeper than love
With my friends
People come and some people go and some people ride to the end
 
When I am blind in my mind
I swear they be my rescue
My lifeline
I don’t know what I’d do if I, if I’d survive
My brothers and my sisters
In my life
Yeah
 
I know some people they would die for me
We run together they’re my family
When I get up they gon’ be high with me
I’ll say forever my family
Family
I’ll say forever my family
I’ll say forever my family
 
Stolen dreams took our, our childish days
Still
Ain’t nothing changed now we’re grown
We’re still young still got our mindless ways
And our timeless phase kicking songs

When I am blind in my mind
I swear they be my rescue
My lifeline
I don’t know what I’d do if I, if I’d survive
My brothers and my sisters
In my life
Yeah
 
I know some people they would die for me
We run together they’re my family
When I get up they gon’ be high with me
I’ll say forever my family
Family
Family
I’ll say forever my family
Family
I’ll say forever my family
 
I know some people they would die for me
We run together they’re my family
When I get up they gon’ be high with me
I’ll say forever my family
